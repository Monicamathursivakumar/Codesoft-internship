Hello, Everyone!

Welcome to my "CodSoft" repository! During my online internship with CodSoft, I had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects, which I am thrilled to share with you.

Projects Included:

Portfolio Project:

This personal portfolio website showcases my skills, experience, and past work. It demonstrates my ability to craft a professional and visually appealing online presence using HTML and CSS.

Landing Page Project:

This landing page is designed to grab visitors' attention and drive conversions. It highlights my understanding of responsive design, effective layout, and user experience principles.

Calculator Project:

A fully functional calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. This project allowed me to apply JavaScript to create interactive features and improve user experience.

Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring and presenting the content of the web pages.
CSS: For styling, layout, and ensuring the projects are visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript: Used specifically in the Calculator project to add dynamic functionality and interactivity.

Each project is organized in its own folder.
